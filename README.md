Welcome to AetioMed!

## Introduction

AetioMed is an advanced system designed to generate synthetic medical cases for educational and training purposes. By leveraging state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (Large Language Models), AetioMed creates realistic patient scenarios, including detailed anamnesis (medical history), chief complaints, and clinical context.

This tool aims to support medical educators and institutions in creating diverse and consistent training materials, ensuring high-quality resources for students and professionals.

## Features

- **Automated Case Generation**: Instantly create detailed medical cases based on specific parameters or random generation.
- **Clinical Consistency**: Ensures that generated symptoms, history, and diagnoses are medically consistent.
- **Multi-stage Verification**: Uses a "Council" and "Consistency" review process to refine generated content.
- **Structured Data**: Outputs data in structured formats suitable for integration with other educational platforms.
